# Semgrep rules for smart contracts

In this repository you can find [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) rules that look for patterns of vulnerabilities in smart contracts based on actual DeFi exploits as well as gas optimization rules that can be used as a part of the CI pipeline. The rules are part of the semgrep registry under [p/smart-contracts](https://semgrep.dev/p/smart-contracts).

## Disclaimer

Currently semgrep supports [Solidity](https://semgrep.dev/docs/language-support/) in `experimental` mode. Some of the rules may not work until Solidity is in `beta` at least.

## Scanning

1) By cloning the repository:

  ```shell
  $ semgrep --config solidity/security path/to/your/project
  ```

2) By using [semgrep registry](https://semgrep.dev/r):

  ```shell
  $ semgrep --config p/smart-contracts path/to/your/project
  ```

3) In your CI:

Create `run-semgrep.yaml` in `.github/workflows` with the following contents:
<details>
  <summary>run-semgrep.yaml</summary>
  
```yaml
# Name of this GitHub Actions workflow.
name: Run Semgrep

on:
  # Scan changed files in PRs (diff-aware scanning):
  pull_request: {}
  # On-demand 
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  semgrep:
    # User-definable name of this GitHub Actions job:
    name: Scan
    # If you are self-hosting, change the following `runs-on` value: 
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    container:
      # A Docker image with Semgrep installed. Do not change this.
      image: returntocorp/semgrep

    # Skip any PR created by dependabot to avoid permission issues:
    if: (github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]')

    steps:
      # Fetch project source with GitHub Actions Checkout.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # Fetch semgrep rules
      - name: Fetch semgrep rules
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          repository: decurity/semgrep-smart-contracts
          path: rules
      # Run security and gas optimization rules
      - run: semgrep ci --sarif --output=semgrep.sarif || true
        env:
           SEMGREP_RULES: rules/solidity/security rules/solidity/performance
      # Upload findings to GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard
      - name: Upload findings to GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: semgrep.sarif
        if: always()
```
</details>

## Testing

Each rule is accompanied by an actual vulnerable source code that was targeted by an exploit. Vulnerable lines are marked with `// ruleid: ...`

In case a rule is not yet supported by semgrep, you will find `// todoruleid: ...`

Run tests: 

```shell
$ semgrep --test solidity
```

Validate rules: 

```shell
$ semgrep --validate --config solidity
```

Feel free to submit any issues with the precision and quality of the rules!

## Gas Optimization Rules

Rule ID | Description
--- | ---
array-length-outside-loop | Caching the array length outside a loop saves reading it on each iteration, as long as the array's length is not changed during the loop.
init-variables-with-default-value | Explicitly initializing a variable with its default value costs unnecessary gas.
state-variable-read-in-a-loop | Replace state variable reads and writes within loops with local variable reads and writes.
unnecessary-checked-arithmetic-in-loop | A lot of times there is no risk that the loop counter can overflow. Using Solidity's unchecked block saves the overflow checks.
use-custom-error-not-require | Consider using custom errors as they are more gas efficient while allowing developers to describe the error in detail using NatSpec.
use-multiple-require | Using multiple require statements is cheaper than using && multiple check combinations. 
use-nested-if | Using nested is cheaper than using && multiple check combinations.
use-prefix-decrement-not-postfix | The prefix decrement expression is cheaper in terms of gas.
use-prefix-increment-not-postfix | The prefix increment expression is cheaper in terms of gas.
use-short-revert-string | Shortening revert strings to fit in 32 bytes will decrease gas costs for deployment and gas costs when the revert condition has been met.
non-payable-constructor | Consider making costructor payable to save gas.
non-optimal-variables-swap | Consider swapping variables using `($VAR1, $VAR2) = ($VAR2, $VAR1)` to save gas.
inefficient-state-variable-increment | <x> += <y> costs more gas than <x> = <x> + <y> for state variables.

## Best Practices Rules

Rule ID | Description
--- | ---
use-abi-encodecall-instead-of-encodewithselector | To guarantee arguments type safety it is recommended to use `abi.encodeCall` instead of `abi.encodeWithSelector`.
use-ownable2step | By demanding that the receiver of the owner permissions actively accept via a contract call of its own, `Ownable2Step` and `Ownable2StepUpgradeable` prevent the contract ownership from accidentally being transferred to an address that cannot handle it.
